      by Garth A. Wilson, and is not meant to replace it as a teaching tool for
      learning the language of the Dine (Navajo) people. The audio samples
      contained were isolated from a copy of the pronunciation CD included with
      the book. This was done to make using the book and creating flashcards
      easier. The book and pronunciation CD include more tips on pronunciation,
      along with an entire other CD and collection of exercises.

      Why use the term Navajo instead of Dine?
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Navajo" is a name other groups have used to identify the Dine people. The
      book uses the Navajo along with Dine, so I've used Navajo as the default
      term even though that's less than ideal, and should be changed over to
      Dine.

    <p>
      The dictionary is stored in a spreadsheet that only I currently have
      access to, in order to prevent unwanted edits. I've also added all the
      words from the pronunciation section of the book so I don't currently have
      plans to add any more words. HOWEVER, the codebase is pretty simple and I
      would be ok with someone else picking up and expanding the project as long
      as they keep it open and respectful of the Dine people. You're also free
      to fork the codebase and expand it, or adjust it for other languages.
